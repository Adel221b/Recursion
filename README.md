# Development

# Problem that the code solves

The code demonstrates how an issue may be broken down into smaller instances of the same problem and ultimately solved by using recursion to calculate factorials.

# Problem-solving arrproach 

1) Understand the Problem: 
I begin by trying to fully comprehending the problem I need to solve. This is done by breaking down the problem statement, identifying the inputs and  outputs.

2) Plan the Solution: 
I try to sketch out the logic of my solution on a high level by considering algoritms, data structures etc.

3) Pseudocode: 
I write pseudocode of my solution in plain language and no syntax.

4) Code:
I translate my pseudocode into actual code. I try to break down solutions into functions and modules in order make it more readable / maintainable.

5) Debugging: 
I run the code to identify any errors or unexpected behavior and fix it.

6) Testing: 
I perform testing to ensure that my solution works correctly. 

7) Optimization: 
When possible, I try to evaluate the efficiency of muy code and improve it where I can.
